### Project Update: Idea for Database Usage

Over the past week, I have been in further contact with the Dodgers about using their database to dynamically pull information into the model. This would help a lot considering I only have 3 million rows right now and would ideally like more to make the model more accurate without overfitting. So, instead of working on the actual implementation of the model this week, I have been understanding how the Dodger's database works and what I will be able (and won't be able) to use to pull for this and other projects. With that said, I just need to do some further refinement of my model in order to have it working for the presentation.
