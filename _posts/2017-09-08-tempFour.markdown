### Project Update: Idea for Database Usage

Over the past week, I have been working on further development of my model. I am running into an issue with One Hot Encoding for the pitch type because of inconsistencies in the csv file. If I take out pitch type as a feature, the SHAP values seem to work, but pitch type is, in fact, one of the more important factors for which I want to account. I am going to continue working to get the pitch type to work, but having this as my first real project with ML, I am a bit lost as of now...to Stack Overflow and ChatGPT I go! Otherwise, I think I am making some good progress and am going to start compiling stuff for my presentation soon.
